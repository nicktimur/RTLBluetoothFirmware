# RTLBluetoothFirmware

Realtek RTL8761B / RTL8761BU Bluetooth firmware loader for macOS (OpenCore Hackintosh).

Makes the TP-Link UB500, UB600, and other RTL8761B/RTL8761BU USB dongles work as a real
Bluetooth controller on macOS 12–26 by uploading the Realtek firmware at boot and wake —
the same approach Linux's `btrtl` driver uses, reimplemented as an IOKit kext.

The RTL8761BU ships with no firmware. Linux uploads `rtl8761bu_fw.bin` via HCI
vendor commands before the generic Bluetooth stack takes over; macOS has no
driver that does this, which is why the usual advice is to replace the adapter
with a Broadcom one. This kext performs the firmware upload, then hands the
controller to macOS's own `bluetoothd` (patched by BlueToolFixup).

Confirmed on macOS 26 (Tahoe), OpenCore 1.0.7, Intel: phone and audio
(A2DP/HFP/AVRCP) connected, battery reporting, and HID.

## Status

| Feature | State |
|---|---|
| Firmware upload at boot | Works, automatic on every boot |
| Controller adopted by macOS | Works (`THIRD_PARTY_DONGLE`, real BD_ADDR) |
| Pairing and connecting | Works |
| Audio (A2DP / HFP / AVRCP) and battery | Works |
| HID (mice, keyboards) | Works |
| Discovering brand-new devices | Limited. macOS runs only a short inquiry on this chip, so put a device in pairing mode and select it promptly. Already-paired devices reconnect fine. |
| Sleep/Wake (Power Management) | Works. Firmware is automatically re-uploaded asynchronously on wake. |
| Apple Continuity (Handoff, AirDrop, Universal Clipboard) | Not supported. Requires genuine Apple Bluetooth/Wi-Fi hardware. |

## Download

- Prebuilt kext: latest `.kext` on the [Releases page](https://github.com/bennetzakaria/RTLBluetoothFirmware/releases).
- Build from source: run `make` (see [Build](#build); the firmware is fetched automatically).

This kext targets the TP-Link UB500 (Realtek RTL8761BU). If you would prefer
Bluetooth with no kext at all, a CSR8510 dongle works natively on macOS. See
[Hardware](#hardware) for options and compatibility.

## Hardware

This kext supports the Realtek **RTL8761BU** and **RTL8761B** chipsets (e.g., USB `0x2357 / 0x0604` and `0x0bda / 0xa728`). Other
chips need a different driver or none at all; other RTL8761B(U) dongles can work by
adding their VID/PID to `Info.plist`.

Amazon occasionally ships a revised UB500 under the same listing. Confirm it
reports PID `0x0604` (RTL8761BU) with `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` before
relying on it.

### Not compatible with this kext

Different or newer chips, or Wi-Fi + Bluetooth combos:
UB500 Plus ([B0DKFXGR21](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKFXGR21?tag=bennzo-20)),
UB400 ([B07V1SZCY6](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V1SZCY6?tag=bennzo-20)),
Archer T2UB ([B0BJ7XJ27X](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJ7XJ27X?tag=bennzo-20)),
Archer TX10UB ([B0F9CNQN42](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9CNQN42?tag=bennzo-20)).

Accessory: a short [USB 2.0 extension cable](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=USB+2.0+extension+cable&tag=bennzo-20)
helps if a rear USB-2 port is awkward to reach.

## Requirements

- macOS 12 (Monterey) – 26 (Tahoe), Intel `x86_64`
- **OpenCore** with kext injection
- **[Lilu](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu)** + **[BlueToolFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM)** (BlueToolFixup is what lets `bluetoothd` accept a non-Apple controller — required)
- `SecureBootModel = Disabled` in your OpenCore config (this kext is ad-hoc signed), which is standard for kext-injection hackintoshes
- **Xcode Command Line Tools** (or full Xcode) to build

---

## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gajjartejas/RTLBluetoothFirmware.git
cd RTLBluetoothFirmware
make
```

`make` automatically downloads the Realtek firmware (`rtl8761bu_fw.bin` +
`rtl8761bu_config.bin`) from kernel.org's `linux-firmware`, embeds it into the
kext, compiles, and ad-hoc signs. The firmware blobs are **not** redistributed in
this repo (Realtek's license) — they're fetched at build time.

Result: `RTLBluetoothFirmware.kext`.

## Install (OpenCore)

1. Mount your OpenCore EFI:
   ```sh
   sudo diskutil mount diskXsY        # your EFI partition
   ```
2. Copy the kext:
   ```sh
   cp -R RTLBluetoothFirmware.kext /Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC/Kexts/
   ```
3. Add it to `config.plist → Kernel → Add` (ProperTree OC Snapshot, or by hand):
   - `BundlePath` = `RTLBluetoothFirmware.kext`
   - `ExecutablePath` = `Contents/MacOS/RTLBluetoothFirmware`
   - `PlistPath` = `Contents/Info.plist`
   - `MinKernel` = `21.0.0`, `Enabled` = `true`, `Arch` = `x86_64`
   - Load order: after `Lilu` and `BlueToolFixup`.
4. **First-time only — clear the stale Bluetooth blacklist.** If you previously
   ran the firmware-less dongle, macOS set `bluetoothExternalDongleFailed`. Add
   these to `config.plist → NVRAM → Delete` under GUID
   `7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82`:
   `bluetoothExternalDongleFailed`, `bluetoothInternalControllerInfo`,
   `bluetoothHostControllerSwitchBehavior`.
5. Reboot **with the dongle plugged in** (a USB-2 port is ideal).

The `scripts/` helpers automate install + verification — read them before running;
they touch your EFI.

## Verify

```sh
log show --last boot --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "RTLBluetoothFirmware"'
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -iE "Firmware|Chipset|Address|State"
```
Good = the log shows `download complete`, and **Firmware Version is NOT** the ROM
identity `0x8761 / 0x000B` (it becomes the patch version, e.g. `0xDFC6D922`).

---

## How it works

1. Matches the UB500 `IOUSBHostDevice` early in boot (own `IOMatchCategory`,
   before `bluetoothd`).
2. Sets configuration, opens the HCI interface + interrupt-IN pipe.
3. `HCI Read Local Version` → detects ROM mode; on a warm reboot, sends the Realtek
   vendor reset (`0xFC66`) to drop back to ROM.
4. Parses the `Realtech` epatch container, picks the patch for this ROM version,
   appends the config blob (mirrors `rtlbt_parse_firmware` in `btrtl.c`).
5. Uploads it in 252-byte fragments via `0xFC20`, then `HCI Reset`.
6. Closes all USB handles and releases the device — `bluetoothd` (via BlueToolFixup)
   then drives it as a standard USB HCI controller.

## Known limitations

- **Discovering new devices** is finicky (see table). Paired devices reconnect fine.
- **Continuity** features need real Apple hardware; not fixable here.

## License

**GPL-2.0-or-later.** The firmware-upload protocol is derived from the GPL-2.0
Linux `btrtl` driver; this kext is an independent IOKit implementation of it.
See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Disclaimer

Experimental, community-built, provided as-is. Kernel extensions can crash or
prevent boot. The kext only matches the UB500's `VID/PID`, so if anything misbehaves
at boot, **unplug the dongle** and it's inert. Use at your own risk.
